### Abstract

Maternal trauma influences infant and adult health outcomes and may impact future generations through epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation (DNAm). Research in humans on the intergenerational epigenetic transmission of trauma effects is limited. In this study, we assessed DNAm signatures of war‑related violence by comparing germline, prenatal, and direct exposures to violence across three generations of Syrian refugees. We compared families in which a pregnant grandmother versus a pregnant mother was exposed to violence and included a control group with no exposure to war. We collected buccal swab samples and survey data from mothers and 1–2 children in each of 48 families (n = 131 participants). Based on an epigenome‑wide association study (EWAS), we identified differentially methylated positions (DMPs): 14 were associated with germline and 21 with direct exposure to violence. Most DMPs showed the same directionality in DNAm change across germline, prenatal, and direct exposures, suggesting a common epigenetic response to violence. Additionally, we identified epigenetic age acceleration in association with prenatal exposure to violence in children, highlighting the critical period of in utero development. This is the first report of an intergenerational epigenetic signature of violence, which has important implications for understanding the inheritance of trauma.

## Introduction

Maternal trauma affects the health of the fetus while in utero and throughout adulthood, and may impact future generations through epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation (DNAm)<sup>1–4</sup>. Maternal stressors known to impact a developing fetus include nutritional deficiencies<sup>5</sup> and exposure to toxins<sup>6</sup>, as well as psychosocial stressors such as anxiety<sup>7</sup> and, potentially, exposure to violence and trauma<sup>8,9</sup>. The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) hypothesis formalized the impact of early life adversity on later life health outcomes by identifying strong associations between early life adversity, such as low birthweight and adverse living conditions, with increased risk of cardiovascular disease in adulthood<sup>10,11</sup>. According to DOHaD tenets, the developing fetus is characterized by high phenotypic plasticity and utilizes environmental cues to determine an optimal phenotype to survive the postnatal environment. However, adaptation based on intrauterine cues might select for a phenotype that is ultimately maladaptive in later life, thus increasing the risk of certain diseases<sup>3,12,13</sup>.

The effects of psychosocial stressors and trauma are thought to be transmitted from mother to offspring through cellular changes in the maternal and fetal hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axes and accompanying changes in glucocorticoid metabolism<sup>3</sup>. However, the underlying molecular mechanism that encodes and preserves trauma information for decades into adulthood is not well understood. Extending the predictive power of the DOHaD hypothesis, epigenetic mechanisms have been proposed to mediate the impact of psychosocial stress and trauma on future generations<sup>14,15</sup>.

Environmentally sensitive epigenetic modifications may have evolved at select sites in the human epigenome to provide a rapid, short‑term response to environmental stressors compared to the more slowly evolving genome. Furthermore, a subset of those epigenetic modifications may have evolved to be heritable to transmit the selective advantages of environmental sensitivity to future generations. DNAm, histone modification, and noncoding RNAs help regulate gene expression. DNAm typically refers to the addition of a methyl group to a cytosine nucleotide base that is followed by a guanine base (a CpG site). Changes in DNAm can lead to increases or decreases in gene expression depending on the gene and genome context as well as the developmental stage and replication activity of the genome<sup>16</sup>. DNAm is well studied because it is one of the main epigenetic factors that control gene regulation in mammals, plays a critical role in cellular differentiation and reprogramming, and is sensitive to environmental changes<sup>17</sup>.

Substantial evidence supports the premise that variation in DNAm may mediate the impact of maternal stress and trauma on a range of offspring health outcomes. Specifically, maternal stress and trauma have been associated with changes in newborn DNAm and epigenetic age acceleration as well as indicators of worsened health outcomes such as diabetes<sup>18–22</sup>. More speculative is the idea that trauma‑associated DNAm marks may be transmitted to future generations in humans<sup>4,23,24</sup>. Transmission to the F2 and F3 generations is considered intergenerational epigenetic inheritance, whereas transmission to the unexposed F4 generation and beyond is termed transgenerational epigenetic inheritance<sup>14</sup>. Although the mammalian epigenome is wiped clean of most DNAm marks during gametogenesis and embryogenesis to allow epigenetic reprogramming<sup>25</sup>, there is intriguing support from animal models for environmentally induced epigenetic marks that resist epigenetic reprogramming and are intergenerationally and transgenerationally inherited with phenotypic effects<sup>26,27</sup>. Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, including in response to environmental stimuli, is well documented in yeast, plants, fish, *Caenorhabditis elegans* and *Drosophila*<sup>28–33</sup>. There are fewer examples in mammalian models, but a recent study reported DNAm inheritance in mice up to four generations<sup>34</sup>. In contrast, only a single study in humans has reported associations of trauma exposure in grandmothers with DNAm changes in grandchildren<sup>35</sup>. The study of epigenetic inheritance in humans is complicated because of the difficulty of conducting multigenerational studies as well as the importance of cultural and environmental factors<sup>4</sup>. Overall, the changes in DNAm in humans following fertilization are complex and intricately timed, attesting to the importance of DNAm in early development<sup>36</sup> and supporting the possibility that a small number of DNAm marks may have evolved that are sensitive to the environment and transmissible to future generations.

In this study, we use the DOHaD hypothesis as a framework to investigate epigenetic variation as a mechanism that mediates the impact of psychosocial trauma on future generations. Specifically, we propose the presence of differentially methylated positions (DMPs) in the human epigenome that are sensitive to the psychosocial environment—specifically violence—and are transmissible to future generations. We present results from an epigenome‑wide association study (EWAS) in which we test for associations between DNAm and war‑related violence in a cohort of Syrian refugee families with contrasting direct, prenatal, and germline exposures to war violence. Our three‑generation study cohort with distinct violence exposures is novel among human studies in focusing directly on intergenerational epigenetic signatures. Our hypothesis, namely that exposure to violence may create intergenerational epigenetic marks, has profound implications for our understanding of evolution, such as how a lived experience can become embedded in the genome in an intergenerational manner.

## Results

### Unique three‑generation study design

We used a three‑generation study design to identify DNAm signatures of contrasting developmental exposures to violence—direct exposure of a living person, prenatal exposure of a fetus, and exposure of the germline. We included contrasting groups of three‑generation Syrian families, currently living in Jordan (Fig. 1). The first two groups were exposed to violence that erupted during regional conflicts: first, the Hama city massacre in Syria that started in 1980, and second, the Syrian uprising and subsequent armed conflicts beginning in 2011. In the 1980 exposure group, maternal grandmothers were pregnant before fleeing Syria, meaning their daughters (F2 generation) were prenatally exposed and their grandchildren (F3 generation) were germline‑exposed to war violence. In the 2011 exposure group, mothers (F2 generation) were pregnant before fleeing Syria, meaning the developing fetus was prenatally exposed in utero, while older children in the same family (F3 generation) were directly exposed to conflict. In the control group, Syrian grandmothers and mothers lived in Jordan prior to 1980. Survey data and buccal swab samples were collected from mothers (F2 generation) and 1–2 children (F3 generation) in each family (two F1 grandmothers were also included, one each in the 1980 and control groups). The study included 131 participants and 48 families.

Directly exposed participants included one grandmother in the 1980 exposure group (F1) and mothers and older children in the 2011 exposure group (F2 and F3, n = 42). They endured violent traumatic experiences that included being severely beaten; being persecuted (by the authorities/militia); seeing a wounded or dead body; and seeing someone else severely beaten, shot or killed. Trauma Events scores were calculated as an unweighted count of affirmative answers to a Traumatic Events Checklist<sup>37,38</sup>.

The intergenerational effects of direct violence exposures could be isolated allowing us to compare directly vs prenatally vs germline exposed individuals (see comparison groups in Fig. 1b). Specifically, associations with direct exposure (1980 grandmothers, 2011 mothers, and 2011 older children) vs prenatal exposure (2011 mothers and 2011 younger children) vs germline exposure (1980 younger and older children) were compared to control unexposed participants (Control grandmother, mothers, and children). Study sample characteristics, including demographic and trauma information, for the different comparison groups are presented in **Table 1**.

### Epigenome‑wide association study

DNAm data were generated using the Illumina EPIC BeadChip that assays over 850,000 CpG sites. We conducted an EWAS to identify differentially methylated positions (DMPs) that were associated with each violence exposure.

A two‑stage analytic approach was used. In stage one, we performed three separate EWAS of violence trauma using robust linear regression with robust standard errors. For each violence trauma category (direct, prenatal, or germline), site‑specific beta‑values were modeled as a function of exposure to violence trauma relative to controls (yes/no), adjusting for age at buccal swab collection, sex, and DNAm‑based estimates of the proportion of epithelial cells. In stage two, site‑specific beta‑values were modeled as a function of the same covariates using generalized estimating equations (GEE) to account for clustering by family. This two‑stage approach leveraged the ability of robust regression to minimize the influence of DNAm outliers while GEE accounted for the family relatedness that was inherent to the study design. The final set of DMPs was determined by the overlap in DMPs that met strict Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (p = 6.5×10⁻⁸) in both the robust regression and GEE EWAS.

The final set of 35 DMPs included 14 probes that were associated with germline exposure to violence and 21 probes that were associated with direct violence exposure (Fig. 2; Supplementary Table S1). No DMPs were significantly associated with prenatal exposure to violence. This is the first report of a germline DNAm signature of violence trauma in humans using a cohort study with an unexposed comparison group, which confirms our hypothesis of an intergenerational epigenetic signature of violence. There was no overlap in DMPs associated with germline vs direct violence exposure. However, 32 DMPs showed the same directionality in DNAm differences across all three exposures, suggesting these DMPs may have the same epigenetic response to violence across exposures (Fig. 2).

The largest difference in DNAm relative to unexposed controls was observed at a germline‑associated DMP, **cg01490163**, with lower DNAm among those exposed in germline (Difference: −0.265, 95% CI −0.349, −0.181) (Fig. 2). The site is approximately 3 kb upstream of *KRT36* (Keratin 36). Compared to controls, the highest DNAm was observed at the germline‑associated DMP **cg07462448**, and two direct‑associated DMPs, **cg14117527** and **cg14832449**. Site cg07462448 is annotated to *CASP7*; cg14117527 to *RAB43/ISY1‑RAB43*; and cg14832449 to **RP11‑1028N23.3** (lncRNA).

As stated above, 32 of the 35 identified DMPs showed the same directionality in DNAm differences across all three exposures, e.g., the germline‑associated **cg01490163** showed a statistically significant −0.265 reduction in DNAm in germline‑exposed individuals, but also showed −0.115 and −0.149 reductions in DNAm in direct and prenatally exposed individuals, respectively, that were not significant. This suggests that the 32 DMPs may function similarly across all three exposures, but our sample size may be insufficient to detect such an effect at statistical significance.

Many of the significant DMPs occurred within regions related to regulation of gene expression (EPIC BeadChip is enriched for these). Seven of 35 DMPs occurred in CpG islands and seven in CpG shores (Supplementary Table S1). Twenty‑three DMPs occurred in gene bodies or cis‑regulatory regions including 5′ & 3′ UTRs and TSS200 & TSS1500 regions. Although the frequency of DMPs in these regulatory regions was higher than their frequency in the set of assayed CpG sites, the enrichment was not statistically significant. Gene ontology analyses revealed no enrichment for biological processes in the top ~5000 DMPs (FDR ≤ 0.1).

We conducted sensitivity analyses to test robustness to the distribution of age at sample collection. All germline‑exposed participants were from the F3 generation (younger than average control F1/F2/F3 participants). When we restricted the comparison of germline‑exposed participants to F3 controls, 8 of 14 original DMPs maintained genome‑wide significance, and all association estimates were consistent. For direct exposure, restricting to F2 and F3 (removing two F1 participants) left all 21 DMPs significant.

To assess dose–response, we plotted DNAm versus Trauma Events score for each of the 35 DMPs (Fig. 3). Virtually all DMPs showed a dose–response relationship (except direct‑associated cg04172533 and cg21616755), suggesting additional/continuing trauma leads to further shifts in DNAm at most DMPs rather than a threshold effect.

### Epigenetic age acceleration

We also tested for epigenetic age acceleration in association with violence trauma. Epigenetic aging (biological minus chronological age) can be accelerated by specific forms of early life adversity<sup>43–45</sup>. Given our buccal samples, we used PedBE<sup>47</sup>, Horvath’s Skin & Blood<sup>46</sup>, and a pan‑tissue clock<sup>48</sup>.

Epigenetic and chronological age were highly correlated (r = 0.94–0.99). Using GEE models (adjusting for age, sex, epithelial cell proportion; clustering by family), there was no significant association between epigenetic age acceleration and trauma exposure when analyzing mothers + children together (F2 + F3; n = 129). However, in children only (F3; n = 82), prenatal exposure to violence was significantly associated with epigenetic age acceleration using the PedBE and Skin & Blood clocks (Fig. 4; Supplementary Table S2). This is the first report of epigenetic age acceleration with prenatal exposure to violence trauma, highlighting the critical period of in utero development.

## Discussion

Our three‑generation design with contrasting developmental exposures to war‑related violence among hard‑to‑reach refugee groups revealed 14 DMPs associated with germline exposure and 21 DMPs with direct exposure. Thirty‑two of these sites showed similar directionality across germline, prenatal, and direct exposures, suggesting a common epigenetic signature of violence. We also identified epigenetic age acceleration associated with prenatal exposure in children.

Environment‑associated DMPs may not be constitutively important for gene regulation in all contexts; some may enable flexibility or enhanced responses to future stress (epigenetic “priming”)<sup>53,54</sup> or serve as exposure biomarkers<sup>55</sup>. Early life exposures are often more strongly associated with DNAm differences than later experiences<sup>56,57</sup>, and future generations may be more affected than those directly exposed<sup>58</sup>, consistent with DOHaD tenets. Accelerated epigenetic aging is thought to correlate with accelerated biological aging and may underlie age‑related health outcomes<sup>59</sup>—our results suggest the impact of violence may accelerate the aging trajectory.

**Strengths and limitations.** Strengths include a multigenerational human cohort with distinct exposure contrasts and an unexposed control group. Limitations include the use of buccal cells (chosen to minimize invasiveness; may nonetheless be informative for DNAm studies<sup>60</sup>), relatively small sample sizes typical of refugee genetic studies, and the possibility that other epigenetic mechanisms (histone modification, non‑coding RNAs) play roles.

**Implications.** Findings support intergenerational epigenetic transmission of violence trauma in humans and have implications for humanitarian policy and resource allocation. Given the scale of global displacement (108.4 million forcibly displaced people by end of 2022; 35.3 million refugees)<sup>62</sup>, understanding intergenerational trauma can inform targeted interventions. The presence of heritable epigenetic signatures of violence may reshape prevention efforts and discourage victim‑blaming.

Finally, resilience is widespread among traumatized and marginalized populations<sup>65</sup>. Future work should adopt a positive framework to investigate epigenetic signatures of adaptive mechanisms underlying human tenacity and flourishing<sup>66</sup>.

## Methods

### Study design

Three groups of three‑generation Syrian families with contrasting exposures to violence were sampled (Fig. 1). The Hama city massacre (1980) and the Syrian uprising/armed conflicts (2011) defined exposure groups. Survey data and buccal swab samples were collected from mothers and their children in all exposure groups (and two grandmothers: one in 1980 and one in Control). Details are in Supplementary Table S3.

**Ethics.** The study received ethical approval from The Hashemite University, Amman, Jordan (IRB ID 171.99E; 3/9/2014) and Yale University (IRB ID 1502015359; 4/24/2015). Written informed consent was obtained in Arabic from all participants or their guardians prior to the start of the study. Conducted per the Declaration of Helsinki.

### Study population

Participants were Syrian women who had experienced war and been pregnant during the 1980 or 2011 conflicts, then fled to Jordan, as well as Syrian families who moved to Jordan before 1980. Inclusion criteria: (1) Syrian families who fled armed conflict (all but two fled to Jordan; two fled to Saudi Arabia or Lebanon but were recruited via Syrian relatives in Jordan); (2) single exposure (1980 **or** 2011), no double exposures; (3) for the 1980 group, grandmother pregnant with a daughter during 1980 and the daughter subsequently gave birth to two children; (4) for the 2011 group, mother pregnant during 2011 and also had an older child (older child = direct exposure; younger child = prenatal exposure).

Recruitment (Nov 2015–Dec 2020) used snowball sampling. Data and buccal samples were collected across 48 families: 10 (1980), 22 (2011), 16 (Control). Final n = 131: 45 younger children, 37 older children, 47 mothers, 2 grandmothers.

### Study sample characteristics

Age, sex, and birth order were collected during interview. Proportions of epithelial cells were calculated from DNAm data using robust partial correlation with EpiDISH<sup>67</sup>. Trauma Events score = unweighted count of affirmative answers to the Traumatic Events Checklist<sup>37,38</sup>.

### Buccal sample collection and DNA extraction

Transport Swabs (APCO, Jordan) or Isohelix DNA Buccal Swabs (UK) were used. Participants rinsed with water and brushed both cheeks up to 30 s. DNA extraction used Qiagen DNA Investigator Kit (USA) or Isohelix Xtreme DNA Isolation Kit (UK), following manufacturer recommendations (Qiagen AW2 wash performed twice).

### DNA methylation

DNA was hybridized to the EPIC BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego) at the Hussman Institute for Human Genomics, University of Miami. Raw *.idat* files were processed in R 4.2.0. SeSAMe was used for non‑linear dye‑bias correction, detection p‑value calculation, and noob background correction<sup>68</sup>. ComBat adjusted for bisulfite conversion plate<sup>69,70</sup>. EpiDISH estimated cell type proportions<sup>67</sup>.

**Probe‑level QC.** Probes with zero intensity; cross‑reactivity; non‑CpG probes; <3 beads; sex‑chromosome probes; or failure to reach detection p < 0.05 in >10% of samples were masked. 768,625 probes remained (Bonferroni p = 6.505×10⁻⁸).

**Sample‑level QC.** *ewastools* and *meffil* checked contamination and identity<sup>71,72</sup>. An epigenetic predictor of age<sup>46</sup> and array genotypes were used to confirm identity/duplicates. Poorly performing samples were identified via methylated/unmethylated probe ratio (*meffil*).

Scripts and data files are available (see Code availability).

### EWAS of violence trauma

Two‑stage approach: (1) robust linear regression with robust SEs for three separate EWAS (direct, prenatal, germline) with beta‑values modeled as a function of violence exposure (yes/no) vs controls, adjusting for age at collection, sex, epithelial proportion; (2) GEE specifying clustering by family (exchangeable correlation). Significant DMPs required Bonferroni significance in **both** stages. DMPs were annotated per published annotation<sup>73</sup>.

### Sensitivity analyses

To better control for age differences, direct vs control removed the two grandmothers (restricting to F2+F3). Germline vs control restricted to 1980 and Control children. Dose–response between Trauma Events and DNAm was assessed at significant DMPs.

### Enrichment analyses

GOmeth<sup>74</sup> tested enrichment among top DMPs. Biological process GO terms with 20–200 DMPs were considered. P‑value cutoffs were chosen to yield ~5000 DMPs per comparison (direct vs control p < 4.5×10⁻⁴; prenatal vs control p < 4.7×10⁻³; germline vs control p < 1.5×10⁻³). FDR q ≤ 0.1.

### Epigenetic age estimation

We estimated epigenetic age using PedBE<sup>47</sup>, Skin & Blood<sup>46</sup>, and pan‑tissue<sup>48</sup> clocks. Raw data were noob normalized (SeSAMe<sup>68</sup>), and ages computed with *methylCIPHER*<sup>77</sup>. Epigenetic age acceleration = residual of epigenetic age regressed on chronological age. GEE modeled acceleration vs exposure category (direct, prenatal, germline; referent: control), adjusting for age, sex, epithelial proportion.
